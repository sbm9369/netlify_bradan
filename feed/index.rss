</div></div></div><div class="x-container max width" style="margin: 0px auto;padding: 0px;"  ><div  class="x-column x-sm x-1-1" style="padding: 0px;" ><div class="x-text"  ><p>This is a common question from potential clients and people we work with who need Web services.  The answer is not as clear as it used to be a few years back. Prior to 2014, a web designer and web developer were two separate roles in bringing a website to life, but now it is more common that an individual will work on the web design and then develop the site based on their designs&#8211;or that web developer will design and develop a site simultaneously. That is not to say the roles do not both exist. Most large companies depend on both a web designer and developer. A smaller business can get away with having an individual who can design and develop. Now that we have an understanding on how roles are starting to adapt, let&#8217;s go over the two different roles. </p>
<p>A <b>web designer </b>is an individual that is focused on designing the look and feel of the site. They are responsible for developing and curating content to go on the site and then developing a smooth layout example using software like Photoshop and Illustrator. Some, but not all web designers do know a small amount of HTML and CSS code to work on styling websites with the developer. Usually, that is the extent of a web designer’s coding knowledge.</p>
<p>A <b>web developer </b>is an individual that is focused on functionality and usability. They have to take the content from the web designer and actually make it into a functioning website using code. An average developer will have a grasp of more advanced codes focused on function such as Python and Java. Advanced developers have started using Content Management Systems (CMS) such as WordPress to organize pages of code and provide user friendly dashboard for designers to add new content. A web developer not on brings design to life for websites, but can also build databases and mobile applications. </p>
<p>The folks at Upwork do a very good job of breaking down the responsibilities of each role in their post titled, <a href="https://www.upwork.com/hiring/development/web-design-vs-web-development/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Web Design vs. Web Development</span></a>and we love their mention of “The Unicorn.” They write, “The “unicorn” can take your project from the conceptual stage of visual mock-ups and storyboards, and carry it through front-end development all by themselves. Not that you’d want them to; the real value of developers who design and designers who develop is their ability to speak each other’s languages.”</p>
<p>Because we are a small enterprise of closely knit professionals with expertise and experience that ranges from seasoned public relations and UX professionals to cutting -edge, (heck, bleeding edge) mavericks, we see the unicorn walkthrough the room at the start of every day. </p>
<p>And because our team is so diverse, we stay abreast of all of the new developments <a href="https://enterprisemarketer.com/podcasts/enterprise-marketer-podcast-conference/61-noz-urbina/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">(such as those recently put forth by Noz Urbina for Enterprise Marketer</span></a>) in UX and design concepts and evaluate which ones to implement, which ones to watch (aka the “wait and see method”) and carefully evaluate what will work best for our clients based not only on their industry, but also their organizational values, goals, and most importantly, capacity. </p>
<p>At Bradan, we feel the best work comes from an enterprise that isn’t afraid to be honest with our clients, ask the tough questions, and ensure they have a plan that extends beyond the launch of the Website.  </p>
<p>Because we are a Kansas City/Missouri based business we have the luxury of meeting with our clients face-to-face and that matters to us.  I mean come on, they want to see the unicorn too, right?</p>

In this way, we are able to ensure individuals on our team are knowledgeable of their role as well as closely related roles. </p>

<p>In the past, getting clicks was everything, but now search engines are tracking how people interact with your website: Are people staying on your site and finding the answers the seek? Or are they going back to the search results to find a better answer? Post-click activity is what matters now so the focus is not just on just getting clicks, but also if those clicks are satisfying user intent.</p>
</div><div class="x-text"  ><h4>Keywords are NOT everything, but they&#8217;re still important</h4>
<p>Keyword research still is an important aspect of marketing, but the focus has transcended beyond keywords and focusing on longer keyword phrases that come up in more natural language searches that their target audience uses.</p>
</div><div class="x-text"  ><h4>User experience is IMPORTANT</h4>
<p>Google makes approximately 500 changes to its search algorithm every year. Most of these changes are focused on improving the user experience. Google wants users to find exactly what they&#8217;re looking for in a single search. Writing good content and presenting it in a visceral way assists google in that endeavor, so websites that do so benefit greatly. You want the best content on the internet for the words and phrases used by your audience.</p>
</div><div class="x-text"  ><h4>Size Matters</h4>
<p>Longer articles (1200+ words) perform substantially better than the shorter articles that many websites relied on for years (most less than 500 words). The goal is to present these longer articles in a way that delights the user. </p>
</div><div class="x-text"  ><h4>If you&#8217;re not mobile friendly, you will be left behind</h4>
<p>Google is no longer waiting for website owners to update to mobile friendly platforms. Sites that are not mobile friendly are disappearing from mobile search results (soon to be approximately 60% of US searches). Not appearing for mobile searches can have a devastating effect on your overall SEO performance. If people are not visiting your website when searching, then overtime Google will stop displaying your site in those specific search results. </p>
</div><div class="x-text"  ><h4>Focus on your Audience</h4>
<p>In the past, it was about marketers trying to promote what they wanted people to see. Today it’s about delivering what people actually want to see. Doing so will boost your rankings over time. It doesn’t matter how high you rank if your target audience is dissatisfied with your presentation.</p>
</div><div class="x-text"  ><h4>Social Engagement Is Growing in Importance</h4>
<p>Google does pay attention to Google+, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and other social networks. The majority of online users rely on their social networks for discovering new places, businesses, hobbies, and more. Having a strong social presence can greatly boost your page rankings.</p>
</div><div class="x-text"  ><h4>Videos Still Dominate</h4>
<p>If you can produce short videos, then you should. People enjoy watching videos, and more importantly they enjoy sharing videos to their profiles.</p>
</div><div class="x-text"  ><h4>Voice Searches Are Real</h4>
<p>More and more people are using voice commands to search. Targeting long-tail keywords is the most effective method to capture these searches. </p>
</div><div class="x-text"  ><h4>Google is Going Local</h4>
<p>50 % of mobile searches are intended to find a local business. Google understands this and has been updating its algorithm to account for local search. Having your address and contact information available on your website (and submitting that information to the various search engines) can improve your search results, especially when you’re presenting quality content. </p>

With so much competition entering the market each month, it is important to have a strong brand and marketing techniques to get your business in front of the consumer. The best way to stand out is to have a strong online presence, which is why it is important for small businesses to have a well designed website.</p>
<p class="Normal1">
<p class="Normal1">Your website is an extension of your business that reflects your brand and values. While also being a representation of your business, a website is your best tool to enhance customer service and bring in new customers. In this article, we are going to go over three simple and easy signs that you need a website update.</p>
</div></div></div><div class="x-container max width" style="margin: 0px auto;padding: 0px;"  ><div  class="x-column x-sm x-1-1" style="padding: 0px;" ><h5  class="h-custom-headline" ><span>1)	Your website is not Mobile-Friendly</span></h5><div class="x-text"  ><p>The best way to check if your website is mobile-friendly is use enter your website’s domain address on <a href="https://search.google.com/search-console/mobile-friendly">Google’s Mobile-Friendly Test</a>. Google will examine your website to make sure that it is responsive across all devices and that your text is legible.</p>
<p><strong>Why Mobile-Friendly? </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>72% of consumers who search locally visit a store within a 5 mile distance. (Source: <a href="http://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/10/06/smx-east">Wordstream</a>)</li>
<li>43% of consumers do online research while in the store. (Source: <a href="http://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/10/06/smx-east">Wordstream</a>)</li>
<li>40% of consumers say they moved onto a competitor&#8217;s site after having a bad experience with a poorly designed mobile site (Source: <a href="http://www.themobileplaybook.com/en-us/#/chapter2_1">Google</a>)</li>
<li>1 in 3 smartphone searches were made right before a store visit. (Source: <a href="https://think.storage.googleapis.com/docs/how-advertisers-can-extend-their-relevance-with-search_research-studies.pdf">Google</a>)</li>
<li>50% of consumers visit a store within a day of their local search on a smartphone. (Source: <a href="https://think.storage.googleapis.com/docs/how-advertisers-can-extend-their-relevance-with-search_research-studies.pdf">Google</a>)</li>
</ul>

If your organic search engine rankings are low, you might want to consider updating your website content to refocus on new search engine optimization techniques. In the past, filling your website with strong keywords and backlinks was enough to make it on the front page of Google, but with recent updates in the algorithms that is no longer the case.</p>
</div></div></div><div class="x-container max width" style="margin: 0px auto;padding: 0px;"  ><div  class="x-column x-sm x-1-1" style="padding: 0px;" ><h5  class="h-custom-headline" ><span>3) Your website does not reflect your business anymore</span></h5><div class="x-text"  ><p>Businesses grow and change over time so it is important to make sure your website is evolving with your business. Maybe you have added new team members or services since your last website. Maybe you have changed your brand positioning and your site needs your updated calls to action. </p>
<p>Your website is the center of your online presence and is often the first place a new customer will find your brand. If your website is no longer representing who and what your business does to ensure you are reaching your target audience then it is time to make an update!</p>

E-commerce means electronic commerce and refers to any type of business, or commercial transaction that involves the transfer of information via the Internet.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="cs-content" class="cs-content" ><div id="x-section-6" class="x-section" style="margin: 0px;padding: 45px 0px; background-color: transparent;"  ><div class="x-container max width" style="margin: 0px auto;padding: 0px;"  ><div  class="x-column x-sm x-1-1" style="padding: 0px;" ><div class="x-text"  ><p>E-commerce has become a more popular way to handle business. E-commerce means electronic commerce and refers to any type of business, or commercial transaction that involves the transfer of information via the Internet. E-commerce sites are being used for most companies now and are helping to create a faster process for e-commerce-website-design-online-storeconsumers to purchase products. It is important for one to have an updated and functioning e-commerce site to even have a chance at keeping up with other competitors.</p>
<p>One of the biggest things to remember about an e-commerce site is that it operates 24/7. Through an e-commerce site, consumers can purchase items 24/7 from all over the world, which means that companies need to be able to provide support 24/7. Even shipping companies have started to deliver 24/7, such as how UPS has started delivering on Sundays now. If one has an e-commerce site they need to make sure that they have support for their site 24/7.</p>
</div></div></div><div class="x-container max width" style="margin: 0px auto;padding: 0px;"  ><div  class="x-column x-sm x-1-2" style="padding: 0px;" ><img  class="x-img x-img-none"  src="https://i1.wp.com/bradan.co/contents/data/2017/05/Business-Continuity-Career-Development-copy.jpg?w=846&#038;ssl=1"  data-recalc-dims="1"></div><div  class="x-column x-sm x-1-2" style="padding: 0px;" ><div class="x-text"  ><p>Another big trend out there is the idea of getting more customers than inventory. This idea suggests that companies sell products before developing the products in advance at a discounted price to gain more customers. There has been a lot of emphasis lately on e-commerce sites. Some have suggested that e-commerce stores should start using Apple Pay because they believe it is going to be the new popular way of making online purchases. It is a smart choice to add multiple payment options to one’s site. You can also look into using paypal, dwolla, and stripe.</p>
</div></div></div><div class="x-container max width" style="margin: 0px auto;padding: 0px;"  ><div  class="x-column x-sm x-1-1" style="padding: 0px;" ><div class="x-text"  ><p>Additionally, many retailers have begun experimenting with the in-store experience so that customers can browse online and use the store as their own personal pick-up center. It is about being faster, cheaper and more convenient for the customers as well as the retailer. For one’s site this means that the e-commerce site needs to be responsive, mobile-friendly, simple design, and shop friendly.</p>
<p>This leads into the trend of implementing a more responsive design for one’s e-commerce site. People make a lot of their online purchasing via their smartphones, which means e-commerce sites need to have responsive sites built for mobile use otherwise consumers will not finish out the purchase.</p>
</div></div></div><div class="x-container max width" style="margin: 0px auto;padding: 0px;"  ><div  class="x-column x-sm x-1-2" style="padding: 0px;" ><img  class="x-img x-img-none"  src="https://i1.wp.com/bradan.co/contents/data/2017/05/mobile-shopper-stats-ecommerce-website.png?w=846&#038;ssl=1"  data-recalc-dims="1"></div><div  class="x-column x-sm x-1-2" style="padding: 0px;" ><div class="x-text"  ><p>Beyond responsiveness, it is important that one recognizes that content is still king. This means that more content such as images and product information need to be placed with whatever one is trying to sell. It is also about just making one’s e-commerce site look more attractive to the consumer. Video content will and should be used more to help sell a product. Having social videos at the front of one’s site helps draw in customers. Also, short social videos are good for advertising through social networks like Facebook, Twitter, and Youtube accounts.</p>
</div></div></div><div class="x-container max width" style="margin: 0px auto;padding: 0px;"  ><div  class="x-column x-sm x-1-1" style="padding: 0px;" ><div class="x-text"  ><p>These are the new trends in e-commerce sites. Hopefully, they will help in assisting you on making your next e-commerce site or when making updates to the site you already have. These are the trends as of now, but eventually new trends will come so it is important to always be making the appropriate updates to your site.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="cs-content" class="cs-content" ><div id="x-section-7" class="x-section" style="margin: 0px;padding: 45px 0px; background-color: transparent;"  ><div class="x-container max width" style="margin: 0px auto;padding: 0px;"  ><div  class="x-column x-sm x-1-1" style="padding: 0px;" ><div class="x-text"  ><p>Having a strong online presence was once a commodity that many dental practices could avoid. However, in the age of Google, this is no longer the case. It is now imperative that dental practices not simply have a website; they need an amazing website. They need a website that can set them apart from every other dental practice within a 20 mile radius.</p>
<p>Most web designers will tell you that your website should be an engaging and a useful resource for your patients. Additionally, a web designer may tell you that your dental website should serve as an introduction to your practice’s image and philosophy. While all of this is true, it’s not the full story.</p>
</div></div></div><div class="x-container max width" style="margin: 0px auto;padding: 0px;"  ><div  class="x-column x-sm x-2-3" style="padding: 0px;" ><div class="x-text"  ><p>There are two aspects to every dental website: the <strong>practice</strong> and the <strong>patient</strong>. Traditionally, you would populate your dental website with content that you believe that your patients may find useful. You’ll have pages that describe different services or conditions; you’ll have a page that describes your practice (the about us page), and you’ll have a homepage and a contact page. <em>However, traditionally the patient will not make it past your first page.</em> Patients rarely care about service pages; every dentist can provide cleanings, fillings, root canals, etc. For most dental websites, this means that patients are not interested in 60-80% of the content available on their dentist’s website. Who’s reading this content then? Probably no one, but perhaps a stranger in Bolivia, or another dentist two states over.</p>
</div></div><div  class="x-column x-sm x-1-3" style="padding: 0px;" ><img  class="x-img x-img-none"  src="https://i2.wp.com/bradan.co/contents/data/2017/02/root-canal-graphic-for-dentist-website-kansas-city.jpg?w=846&#038;ssl=1"  data-recalc-dims="1"></div></div><div class="x-container max width" style="margin: 0px auto;padding: 0px;"  ><div  class="x-column x-sm x-1-1" style="padding: 0px;" ><div class="x-text"  ><p>EITHER WAY, THE CONTENT SERVES NO PURPOSE FOR YOU!</p>
<p>And that is what we mean by objective oriented design. The most amazing website can be an utter failure for your business. The design may be amazing, the functionality superb, and yet the conversion rate less than desirable. If your site does not increase your patient base, then what is the purpose of your dental website?</p>
<p>Every dentist needs a website, not because they need something to show family members, but because they need a useful tool that can effectively increase their patient base. There is no other purpose to a dental website than to increase the number of patients for the practice.</p>
<p>A dental website should effectively warm-sell potential patients who visit the website. To do this the website needs to be streamlined with custom, non-generic content that focuses specifically on the questions that the majority of patients have; namely how will they be treated, will their insurance be accepted, and most importantly can they afford to come to your practice specifically (e.g., do you offer CareCredit plans, or some other form of payment plans, etc.). Additionally, this content should be copyrighted and published across all media platforms (e.g. google+, Facebook, Twitter).</p>
<p>Since the content will be streamlined, the dental website should be designed around this content and provide multiple call-out sections that will prompt visitors to contact the office or schedule their appointment online. The overall design should be a cross between a landing page and a traditional website. This will allow the website to access the high conversion ratio of the landing page structure while also appealing to potential patients through high quality content and organization.</p>
<p>IN SUMMARY, your dental website should be designed FOR ONE PURPOSE: TO CONVERT POTENTIAL PATIENTS INTO ACTUAL PATIENTS.</p>
